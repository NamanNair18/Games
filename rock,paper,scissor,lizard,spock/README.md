# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game

# Description

This is a Python implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, an extended version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game pits a human player against the computer, which randomly selects its choice. The player selects an option by entering a number (0-4), and the winner is determined based on predefined rules.

# Game Rules

The game includes five options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock. The winning conditions are:





Scissors cuts Paper



Paper covers Rock



Rock crushes Lizard



Lizard poisons Spock



Spock smashes Scissors



Scissors decapitates Lizard



Lizard eats Paper



Spock vaporizes Rock



Rock crushes Scissors

If both the player and computer choose the same option, the result is a draw.
