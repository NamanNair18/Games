# World Guessing Games 

Overview

The Word Guessing Game is a simple, interactive command-line game written in Python. Players attempt to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting one letter at a time, with a limited number of attempts (10 by default). The game provides feedback on each guess, displays the current state of the word with underscores for unguessed letters, and tracks previously guessed letters to enhance the player experience.

This project is ideal for beginners learning Python, demonstrating concepts like random selection, loops, conditionals, lists, and user input handling.

Features
1)Random Word Selection: Chooses a word from a predefined word bank.
2)Case-Insensitive Guessing: Letters are matched regardless of case (e.g., "r" matches "R").
3)Input Validation: Ensures guesses are single alphabetical characters.
4)Guess Tracking: Prevents repeated guesses and displays all previously guessed letters.
5)User-Friendly Interface: Includes a welcome message, instructions, and clear feedback on guesses.
6)Modular Code: Organized into functions for readability and maintainability.
