# Roman Numeral to Integer Converter

Overview

This Python script converts Roman numerals to their corresponding integer values. It handles both standard and subtractive notation (e.g., "IV" for 4, "CM" for 900) and includes input validation to ensure robustness. The code is simple, efficient, and suitable for educational purposes or integration into larger projects.

Features
